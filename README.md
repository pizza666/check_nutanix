check_nutanix
=============

Nagios/Icinga Check which checks the Status of a given Nutanix Cluster trough its API.

- basic auth is disabled for now, because our clusters only handle client certificate -> tests needed
- maybe VM checks and open alerts should be devided by methods so it can be checked individually?
